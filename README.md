# Cycle
Cycle is a game where the players try to cut each other off using cycles that leave a trail behind them. It's just like tron, trying to cut off the other player with the only space you got. Cycle can be a fun game or a really hard game. Find out for yourself.

Players can move up, down, left and right...
Player one moves using the W, S, A and D keys.
Player two moves using the I, K, J and L keys.
Each player's trail grows as they move.
Players try to maneuver so the opponent collides with their trail.

Players keep moving and turning but don't run into each other.
